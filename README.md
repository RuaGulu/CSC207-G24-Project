## API: 

Weather API:

We connected with Weather API from weatherapi.com, which is an API can help us get detailed weather conditions for both now and future forecast. We have chose this API as it is free for us to try out first with limited information but enough for now.

Weather API Documentation URL: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/

## Sample output of Java code (Test):

## Issues that may slow down development progress:
* APIs are no longer free or not available, that we have to switch to another source.

* Time needed to implement new features, and finding information for features.

* Time consuming to implement personal preferences setup.
